# DependencyKit

DependencyKit is an attempt to make a typesafe and usable, lightweight, dependency injection framework for Swift.

Demo usage:
```
❯ swiftc Framework/*.swift DemoApplication/*.swift DemoApplication/GeneratedCode/*.swift main.swift
❯ ./main
Root
Overriden value
Root
Could this be less verbose?
```
